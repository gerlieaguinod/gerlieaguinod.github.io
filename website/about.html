          <h1>ABOUT</h1>
          <p>This website features a specialized calculator designed to solve word problems involving the application of separable variables. It currently includes tools for Growth and Decay calculations, Newton's Law of Cooling and Heating, and Unit Conversion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column2">
          <h1>LIMITATIONS</h1>
          <p>The website has certain limitations. It is designed to handle growth and decay calculations using years as the time unit and temperature calculations using minutes. Additionally, it only supports temperature values in Fahrenheit. The program can solve for future temperature, time, or growth; however, parameters such as the rate of change, initial temperature or population, and the new temperature or population at a given time must be provided to calculate the desired results..</p>
